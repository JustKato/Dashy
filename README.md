# About

Dashy is a simple dashboard generator, customize it to fit you, I have tried to keep the config as open as possible for anyone to take things on/off as they desire, I have been using homer this whole time myself and found it quite useful, but after a while found the lack of "widgets" to bother me, so I strived to add it in myself, looking at the code-base, it was `incompatible` with my work-style, so I simply decided to remake the whole thing in TypeScript with ExpressJS and HandleBars as a renderer.

# Config

The configuration file has comments all over the place to explain what is happening, but just to make sure here are a couple short tips.
